Floria
======

A dual-paradigm data system for cloud orchestration.

It consists of a data model (the declarative paradigm) integrated with an event-driven plugin execution mechanism (the imperative paradigm), with first-class support for [Wasm](https://webassembly.org) plugins.

This project comprises:

* Storage backends for graph, relational, and "no-SQL" databases
* CLI tools
* A rich terminal UI
* A rich web UI with graphical visualization of topologies
* A library for working with Floria data and plugins
* An SDK for building Wasm plugins for Floria

For a Floria-based orchestrator, see [Khutulun](https://khutulun.org).

For a [TOSCA](https://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA/v2.0/TOSCA-v2.0.html) frontend for Floria, see [Puccini](https://puccini.cloud).
